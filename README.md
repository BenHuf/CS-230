The Gaming Room is seeking a client/server application for their game Draw it or lose it. They have already created the application for android systems and are seeking to have it ported and hosted to other operating platforms. They would like it available on the android and iOS app stores.

I think in the documentation for this class I did a particularly good job suggesting resources and avenues for which platforms could be used for the development and hosting of the proposed application. 

One section I would revise in hindsight is the table on differing development platform descriptions. I would take more time to explore different approaches instead of writing about the pros and cons in regards to the suggested solution of webhosting with a JS frontend and Java backend in mind and take a deeper dive into the particulars of each operating system.

I interpreted the Gaming Room's need as being a transition of the existing application onto other platforms. When considering this I chose a webapp/webhosting angle that allows for clients to be developed for many platforms and for functionality directly in browser on many platforms. Its important to understand the user's needs so that the correct approach can be taken to meet all specifications.

When developing software I refered to all documentation avalaible to ensure correct implementation and integration of dropwizard and other services. When working with 3rd party authentication it is especially important to follow documented examples to ensure a secure product.
